# The First Christmas Story

## A Christmas entry for 10K Apart!

I run one of the biggest Christmas information sites on the web [whychristmas?com](http:/www.whychristmas.com), so I thought it would be fun to get make a <10k version of the Christmas story for 10K Apart.

I started the main site in 2000 for a Primary (Elementary) School here in the UK and it's grown and grown over the years. The site is used by schools and teachers of English as a foreign language all over the world. 

This special 'mini' version is an easy to read version of the Christmas story for anyone!

It uses minimal HTML & CSS and some basic JS to help with lazy loading the images - but you can read the story without any images. (There's some nice progressive enhancement. If you have JS, when you click to see an image it lazyloads and replaces the button. If you don't have JS when you click to see a button you go straight to the image and can use the back button to return to the story.)

All the images are SVGs. I created the Christmas story graphics, which are also used throughout the main site (and I also really want to get some 'Got Myrrh' tshirts printed!).

The design is inspired by Material and it works well accross all sizes of screens.

As well as viewing it on Github you can also see it out on the web at https://firstchristmasstory.com :)
